<div align='center'><h1>Disposable Mask Segmentation</h1></div>

Following the coronavirus crisis, many disposable masks are found in the outdoor environment: in the street, in nature. This crisis brings a new type of waste to the environment. In order to complete the research in waste detection in the natural environment, I have decided to build a detection system capable of identifying and segmenting these masks. 

[SAMPLE IMAGES]

This type of detector could be of interest for building automated systems for collecting waste in the streets for example. 

## 1 - Data

For this purpose, 65 images of masks found outdoors were used. For the moment, this dataset is small because I started the project at the beginning of 2021. Nevertheless, my relatives and I are collecting new ones every day in order to complete this dataset. 

My goal is to collect 1000 images. 

If you wish to contribute to this project and strengthen the detection system, please feel free to capture images on your side and send them to me by email: cochenercamille@yahoo.fr !
